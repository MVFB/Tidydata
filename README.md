# Tidydata
The code works in 6 steps
In step 1 it loads the packages needed to run the script
In step 2 it loads all the Samsung data (the data must be stored in your working directory)
In step 3 it merges the training and test sets into a new dataset (object called working_data)
In step 4 it extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
In step 5 it includes in the dataset the activity data.
In step 6 it creates a second, independent tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. It stores the result in an object named tidy_data.
