Raw data: data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone obtained from the link http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

Data load: training and test data, including subjects, activities and features are loaded into the code.

Files loaded:
./train/X_train.txt
./test/X_test.txt
./features.txt
./activity_labels.txt
./train/y_train.txt
./test/y_test.txt
./train/subject_train.txt
./test/subject_test.txt

Data transformation:
1. training and test data are merged into object named working_data
2. variables names are inserted into working_data
3. extraction of columns which names contain the characters mean or std 
4. activity data is inserted into working_data
5. a new data set is created (tidy_data) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Output: tidy_data, which is a dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
